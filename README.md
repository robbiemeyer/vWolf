# vWolf

vWolf is a virtual moderator for the game of werewolf. In a regular game of
werewolf someone must sit out to moderate the game. vWolf can take this role
and allow all players to be able to participate.

A good resource for the rules for werewolf can be found here:

## Features
vWolf can currently:
- Assign players the roles of werewolf and villager
- Count votes
- Determine when the game ends

vWolf does not currently implement any roles other than villager and werewolf.
Other roles such as seer are planned. 

vWolf does not attempt to control the game. It is still suggested to have a player
lead the game. vWolf does allow the game leader to also paeticipate in the game.
